    "\n",
    "In machine learning, a training dataset is a collection of data that is used to train a machine learning model. It consists of input data (features) and corresponding output labels (targets) that the model learns from. The training dataset is used to teach the model how to make predictions or classifications based on the patterns and relationships present in the data. The quality and size of the training dataset can significantly impact the performance of the machine learning model.\n",
